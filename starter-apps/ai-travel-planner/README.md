All content can be automatically translated to your preferred language using Sutra LLM, including:

- Daily itineraries and activity suggestions
- Destination research and local information

## Environment Variables

You can set the following environment variables instead of entering them in the UI:

- `SUTRA_API_KEY`: Your Sutra API key

## Data Privacy
